    - based on predator stormbreaker x4.6
- [Power HAL] Major improvements
    - [Powerhint] Switched to `sysctl` to control energy aware
        - Energy aware feature control is previously done through debugfs,
        which will be deprecated, so move the control to sysctl.
    - [Powerhint] Bring back `interaction`, without the bugged ones
        - Bugged: `CPULittleClusterMinFreq`

## v4.2.0 08.06.21'

- [General] Reduced jitter [dc652a7](https://github.com/PotatoDevices/device_xiaomi_sdm660-common/commit/dc652a70533065279b97818eb0e026bf23b24750)
    - Less time opening Twitter photos, etc.

---

## v4.1.6 31.05.21'

- [General] User Build
    - We had some neverallows while tryna to build user builds with potato on lavender, we have removed all of them as device-sepolicy side and legacy-um side :).
- [Audio HAL] Switch to Audio HAL v5
- [SoundTrigger] Update audio configs and enable soundtrigger
    - Well, some people reported that they can't use Ok Google and stuff, this is now completely fixed.
- [Overlays] Donâ€™t enforce RRO for all overlays
    - Fixed /product/overlay.
    - This makes many platform specific overlays with current system API on vendor partition which breaks newer android version compatibilities (broken stuffs in gsis).
- [zRAM] Update and optimize zRAM configuration
    - post_boot: Ensure SLAB_STORE_USER is disabled for zram kmem_caches
    - post_boot: update zRAM setting avoid 32 bit overflow
- [Power HAL] General optimizations
    - Relax memlat from post_boot and let libperfmgr handles it
    - powerhint: Decrease launch boost to 3sec
    - powerhint: Remove interaction boosts
        - Fixes `E: Slow writing to file: '/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq' with value: '1113600'`
    - libperfmgr.rc: Let power hal start early
    - libperfmgr.rc: perfmgr now change dex2oat priorities along with overriding readahead to 128KiB after post-boot

## v4.1.5 10.05.21'

- [Blobs] Update WFD and Time blobs from LA.UM.9.2.r1-01800-SDMxx0.0

- [GPS] Localise NTP to improve GPS TTFF
- [GPS] Improved GPS response time
- [WiFi] Disable TDLS OffChannel

 >> `AudioFX:` `Dirac` was buggy, it was not working by default, maybe later i will switch to prebuilt audio hal then `MiSound` will work.

## v4.1.4 19.04.21'

- [Kernel] Upstream Kernel to Predator Stormbreaker x4.5 - 4.4.266
- [Power HAL] Tune down schedtune boost *~saves some battery*
- [ART] Configure `dext2oat` for pre-optimization
- [AdaptLaunch] Improved apps launch time by a notable change
- [Overlays] Set fast charging indicator threshold to 10.8W (old was 7.5W)
- [USB] Enable support for USB Audio accessories
- [zRAM] Allocate zRAM values dynamically
- [zRAM] Fined Tune zRAM writeback

>> `zRAM:` *dynamically?* what's that? simple, we just made it 50% insist of a value, which means, for 3GB it will be ~1.3GB and for 4GB it will be ~1.8GB. The reason for why i did this is because zRAM mechanism takes some CPU performance to give you some free RAM, so exact value as google said (50% of your RAM) == balanced performance.

>> `DeviceSettings:`  app has been nuked to match the Stock AOSP lines.
